# Pursuit-Core-iOS-Post-Request-Practice

This repo contains a starter project that loads a list of `User`s into a Table View.  Continue the project by making it so that tapping a cell sends a POST request to [Postman Echo](https://docs.postman-echo.com/?version=latest) with the user
s information.
